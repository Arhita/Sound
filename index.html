        <p>Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical
             substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms
             (in which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no
              calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains
               one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the
                oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45¬∞. "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions
             for temperature and pressure.A number of natural states of water exist. It forms precipitation in the form
              of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid
             state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of
             water is steam or water vapor.Water covers approximately 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans.
             Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and 
             Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), 
             and precipitation (0.001%).Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration
            (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.Water plays an
             important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to
              agriculture.Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the 
              world. Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured 
              products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, 
              ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent 
              for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial 
              processes, and in cooking and washing. Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other 
              forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, 
              ice skating and skiing.The word water comes from Old English w√¶ter, from Proto-Germanic *watar 
              (source also of Old Saxon watar, Old Frisian wetir, Dutch water, Old High German wazzar, German Wasser,
               vatn, Gothic êçÖêå∞êçÑêçâ (wato), from Proto-Indo-European *wod-or, suffixed form of root *wed- 
               ("water"; "wet"). Also cognate, through the Indo-European root, with Greek œçŒ¥œâœÅ (√Ωdor), RussianWater (H
               2O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly
             colorless with a hint of blue. This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical
              compound and is described as the "universal solvent" for its ability to dissolve many substances.
              This allows it to be the "solvent of life":indeed, water as found in nature almost always includes various
             dissolved substances, and special steps are required to obtain chemically pure water. Water is the only 
             common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas in normal terrestrial conditions.–≤–æ–¥–∞ÃÅ (vod√°), Irish 
            uisce, and Albanian uj√´.Along with oxidane, water is one of the two official names for the chemical compound H
            2O;it is also the liquid phase of H2O.The other two common states of matter of water are the solid phase,
            ice, and the gaseous phase, water vapor or steam. The addition or removal of heat can cause phase transitions
            freezing (water to ice), melting (ice to water), vaporization (water to vapor), condensation (vapor to water),
            sublimation (ice to vapor) and deposition (vapor to ice).</p>

            <h2>1. Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Only run the washing machine and dishwasher when you have a full load.

                <br>
                6. Don‚Äôt overwater your lawn or water during peak periods, and install rain sensors on irrigation systems.
                <br>
                <br>
                7. Install a rain barrel for outdoor watering.

                <br>
                <br>
                10. Share your knowledge about saving water through conservation and efficiency with your neighbors.
